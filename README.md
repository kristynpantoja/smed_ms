The repository accompanying ``Sequential Minimum Energy Designs for Model Selection and Checking,'' by Kristyn Pantoja, David E. Jones, Huiyan Sang, and Rui Tuo (2022). It contains implementations of SeqMED along with the code to run experiments and create plots.

To reproduce the plots in the manuscript, visit the lm_experiments/lm and gp_experiments/gp directories.
